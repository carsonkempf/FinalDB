        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>My project idea is to make a fitness management system that allows users to track and organize each of their exercises, create a routine, rate, and take notes on each routine created. Keeping up with fitness goals is difficult, especially as life becomes more and more busy, so this fitness management system will make each workout simple and trackable. I wish to create a fitness management system in a web application that allows users to interact with it. A database system will allow the data to be stored efficiently while data retrieval can take place.</p>

        <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Adding exercises (user, exercises) – a user adds exercises to the database</li>
            <li>Editing/deleting (user, exercises) – a user can edit exercises in the database or delete them</li>
            <li>
                Grouping
                <ul>
                    <li>exercises into workouts (user, exercises, workouts) – create workouts comprised of exercises</li>

        <h2>Conceptual Schema Summary</h2>
        <p>The database system is designed to store a large number of exercises that a user can access and append to create workouts, weekly routines, and schedules. The user compiles variations of the exercises to create personalized workouts. Each workout must have at least one exercise each weekly routine must have at least one workout, each schedule must have at least one weekly routine.</p>
